\begin{abstract}
UrDHT is an abstract model of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).
It maps the topologies of DHTs to the primal-dual problem of Voronoi Tessellation and Delaunay Triangulation.
DHTs have an inherent set qualities, such as greedy routing, maintaining lists of peers which define the topology, and form an overlay network. 
By completing a few simple functions, a developer can implement the topology of any DHT in any arbitrary space using UrDHT.
For example, we implemented a DHT operating in a hyperbolic space, a previously unexplored nontrivial metric space with potential applications.

%Latency embedding will not be included in this paper
%One topology of particular interest we created is a DHT operating within a Poincar\'{e} disk model.
%This DHT could have latency embedded within the overlay and be capable of responding to changes in latency.
%The consequence of this is that, unlike other DHTs, the routing algorithm always uses the shortest latency path to a given destination.

\section{Introduction}
%Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) have been extensively researched for the past decade.
%Many different DHT protocols have developed over the years.
%What is a DHT
% Mention the DHT API
%Despite this, no one has created a cohesive formal specification for building a DHT. % or something


%UrDHT is our specification and implementation of an abstract DHT.



UrDHT is an abstract implementation of a DHT which solves a number of problems.
First, it is a unified and cohesive model for creating distributed hash tables and P2P applications based on DHTs.
Second, it provides a single network for bootstrapping distributed applications.
Third, we show that using the abstraction features of UrDHT, we can embed latency into the DHT's overlay.
%
\subsubsection{Abstraction}

Distributed Hash Tables have been the catalyst for the creation of many P2P applications.
Among these are Redis \cite{redis}, Freenet \cite{freenet}, and, most notably, BitTorrent \cite{bittorrent}. 
All DHTs use roughly the same protocol to perform lookup, storage, and retrieval operations.
Despite this, no one has created a cohesive formal specification for building a DHT.

Our primary motivation for this project was to create an abstracted Distributed Hash Table based on observations we made during previous research \cite{dgvh}.
In that paper, we discovered that all DHTs can cleanly be mapped to the primal-dual problems of Voronoi Tessellation and Delaunay Triangulation.

UrDHT directly builds its topology using this insight, using a greedy distributed heuristic for approximating Deluanay triangulations.
It is our specification of an abstract DHT, which can be used to build of DHTs.
We found that we could reproduce the topology of different DHTs by defining a selection heuristic and rejection algorith for the space.
For every DHT we tried, fast approximation of Delaunay triangulation using a distance and midpoint functions for the space produced a stable DHT.  
This works in non-eulcidean spaces such as XOR (Kademelia) or even a hyperbolic space represented by a Poincar\`{e} disc.

The end result is not only do we have an abstract model of DHTs, we have a simple framework that developers can use to quickly create new distributed applications.
This simple framework allows generation of internally consistent implementations of different DHTs that can have their performance rigorously compared.  %IE we can now test DHTs against each other fairly



\subsubsection{Bootstrapping}
Another poorly addressed issue with DHTs and DHT-based P2P applications we wish to address with UrDHT is the what we have termed the \textit{bootstrapping problem}.
Simply put, a node can only join the network if it knows another node that is already a member of the network it is trying to join.
%
%Current distributed systems suffer from fragmentation, high overhead, and an inability to scale due to difficulty of adoption.



%How does CAN address this or Kademlia or Chord

The general way this works is by having a potential user manually look up at a centralized source, such as the project or application's website, the bootstrapping information.
It is a philosophical conflict required a distributed application using a centralized source of information to build a distributed network.


%UrDHT is P2P system designed to improve the adaptability of P2P distributed serves.


%The other motivation is making it easier for users to create distributed applications.
%What topology do you use?
%How do we want our program to communicate over the network?

UrDHT has the potential to be a distributed source for joining the distributed application development time and making it easier to adopt by creating a network to bootstrap \textit{other networks}.
UrDHT does this by making it easy to add other networks as a service.



%\subsubsection{Embedding}
%One of the other features shared by nearly every DHT is that routing works by minimizing the number of hops across the overlay network, with all hops treated as the same length.
%This is done because it is assumed that DHTs know nothing about the state of actual infrastructure the overlay is built upon.

%However, this means that most DHTs will happily route a message from one continent to another and back.
%This is obviously undesirable, but it is the status quo in DHTs.
%This stems from the generation of node IDs in DHTs. 
%Nodes are typically assigned a point in the range of a cryptographic hash funtion, called the keyspace. 
%This ID corresponds to the hash of some identifier or given a point randomly.
%This is done for purposes of load balancing and fault tolerance.

%We asked ourselves if there was a means of embedding latency into the DHT, while still maintaining the system's fault tolerance.
%Doing so would mean that the hops traversed to a destination are, in fact, the shortest path to the destination.

%We found that we could embed a latency graph in a hyperbolic space and defined UrDHT such that it operates within this space.
%The end result was a DHT with latency embedded into the overlay.
%Nodes can respond to changes in latency and the network by effectively moving their positions.
%We use  a force spring model to accomplish this.

\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
To summarize our accomplishments:

\begin{itemize}
	%\item We first discuss our motivation for creating UrDHT and \textit{creating it the way we did}  (Section \ref{sec:motivation}).
	\item We give a formal specification for what needs to be defined in order to create a functioning DHT.
	While there has long existed a well known protocol for distributed hash tables, these define what a DHT needs to be able to do.
	It does not describe what a DHT is.
	
	We show that DHTs cleanly map to the primal-dual problem of Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi tessellations.
	We list a set  of simple functions that, once defined, allow our Distributed Greedy Voronoi Heuristic (DGVH) to be run in any space, creating a DHT overlay for that space (Section \ref{sec:define}).
	
	
	
	\item We present UrDHT as an abstract DHT and show how a developer can tweak the functions we defined to create an arbitrary new DHT topology (Section \ref{sec:urdht}).
	\item We show how to reproduce the topology of Chord and Kademlia using UrDHT, which we call UrChord and UrKademlia (Section \ref{sec:implement}).
	%\item We show how we can embed latency into the overlay of a DHT by placing the DHT into and defining the necessary methods so that DGVH can run in that space  (Section \ref{sec:hyper}).
	
	\item We conduct experiments showing that UrChord sufficiently approximates a correct implementation of Chord (Section \ref{sec:experiments}). 
	\item We discuss the ramifications of our work and what future work is available.
\end{itemize}


\section{What Defines a DHT}
\label{sec:define}

A distributed hash table is usually defined by its protocol; in other words, what it can do.
Nodes and data in a distributed hash table are assigned unique\footnote{Unique with astronomically high probability, given a large enough consistent hash algorithm.} keys via a consistent hashing algorithm.
To make it easier to grok the context, we will call the key associated with a node its ID and refer to  nodes and their IDs interchangeably.

A DHT can perform the \texttt{lookup(key)}, \texttt{get(key)}, and \texttt{store(key, value)} operations.\footnote{There is typically a \textit{delete(key)} operation defined too, but it is not strictly necessary.}
The \texttt{lookup }operation returns the node responsible for a queried key, \texttt{get} returns the value stored with that key with the \texttt{store} function.

However, this is what a DHT \textit{does}, viewing the DHT as a black box, not what a DHT \textit{is} and needs to be implemented.
Here, we open that black box for the first time and present those components.
We show that Distributed Hash Tables are just Voronoi tessellations and Delaunay triangulation.


\subsection{DHT Components}
The following functions need to be defined in order for nodes to perform lookup operations and determine responsibility.

%TODO Which of theses are the discrimination metric
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A \texttt{distance} function } - 
	This measures distance in the overlay formed by the Distributed Hash Table.
	In most DHTs, the distance in the overlay has no correlation with real-world attributes.
	This is not necessarily the case with UrDHT (see Section \ref{sec:hyper}).
	
	\item \textbf{A \texttt{midpoint} function} - This calculates the minimally equidistant point between two given point.
	The midpoint is required for Delaunay triangulation calculation.
	In some spaces, such as Kademlia's XOR metric space, this can be tricky to calculate.  % Is this part of ownership?
	\item \textbf{An \texttt{responsibility} definition}  This defines the range of keys a node is responsible for. 
	Not every DHT defines which node is responsible for particular keys in the same way. 
	For example, nodes in Kademlia are responsible for the keys closest to themselves, while in Chord, nodes are responsible for the keys falling between themselves and the preceding node.
\end{itemize}


A DHT also needs a strategy to organize and maintain two lists of of other nodes in the network: \textit{short peers} and \textit{long peers}.
Short peers are the set of peers that define the topology of the network and guarantee that greedy routing works.

Long peers allow the DHT to achieve a better than linear lookup time, typically $ \log(n) $, where $n$ is the size of the network. 

Interestingly, despite the diversity of DHT topologies, all DHTs use the relatively the greedy routing algorithm (Algorithm \ref{alg:routing}):

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{The DHT Generic Routing algorithm}
	\label{alg:routing}
	\algsetup{linenosize=\tiny}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\STATE Given node $n$ and a message being sent to $key$
		\STATE \textbf{function} $n.$\texttt{lookup}$(key)$
		\IF{If $key \in n$'s range of responsibility}
			\RETURN $ n $
		\ENDIF
		\IF{ One of $n$'s short peers are responsible for $key$}
			\RETURN the responsible node
		\ENDIF
		\STATE $ candidates $ = $ short\_peers $ + $ long\_peers $
		\STATE $ next  \leftarrow $  $\min (n$.distance($candidates$, $ key ))$
		\RETURN $next.$lookup($key$)
	\end{algorithmic}
	
	\scriptsize
\end{algorithm}
If I, the node, am responsible for the key, I return myself.
Otherwise, if I know who is responsible for this key, I return that node.
Finally, if that is not the case, I forward this query to the node I know with shortest distance from the node to the desired key.\footnote{This order matters, as some DHTs such as Chord are unidirectional.} 

Between individual DHTs, this algorithm might be implemented either recursively or iteratively.
It will certainly have differences in how a node handles errors, such as how to handle connecting to a failed node which no longer exists.
This algorithm may possibly be  run in parallel, such as in Kademlia \cite{kademlia}.
Despite this, the base greedy algorithm is always the same between implementations.

The final component is a consistent hashing function.
This function must generate keys large enough to make the chances of a hash collision nigh impossible.
%LEAD INTO MULTIHASH GOES HERE

\subsection{DHTs, Delaunay Triangulation, and Voronoi Tesselation}
With the following components of a DHT defined above we can now show the relationship between DHTs and the primal-dual problems of Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi Tessellation.


We can map a given node's ID to a point in a space, the range of keys a node is responsible for to that node's Voronoi region, and the set of short peers to the Delaunay triangulation.
Thus, if we can calculate the Delaunay triangulation between nodes in a DHT, we have a generalized means of created the overlay network.

This can be done with any algorithm that calculates the Delaunay Triangulation.
However there is a plethora of DHTs with highly diverse spaces. 
The majority of well-known algorithms for solving this problem, such as Fortune's Sweepline \cite{fortune1987sweepline}, are designed to be run centralized.

Is there an algorithm we can use to efficiently calculate Delaunay Triangulations for a distributed system in an arbitrary space?
We created an algorithm call the Distributed Greedy Voronoi Heuristic (DGVH), shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:dgvh} and explained below \cite{dgvh}.


\begin{algorithm} % make smaller

		%	\STATE $long\_peers \leftarrow$ random subset of $long\_peers$ of size $table\_size^2$
		%\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm} 
%TODO We should change how to handle long peers, make it a generalizable function
%TODO Can we generalize further?

%TODO IS THIS HOW WE IMPLEMENT IT IN URDHT? DO WE CHOOSE just one peer in gossip?
%TODO short or all peers
DGVH uses the midpoint to gauge which other nodes to use as its Delaunay triangulation \cite{dgvh}.
Every maintenance cycle, nodes exchange their peer lists with\textbf{ a current neighbor and then recalculate their neighbors.  }
A node creates a list of candidates by combining their peer list with  their neighbor's peer list.
This list of peers is then sorted from closest to furthest distance.
The node then initializes a new peer list with the closest candidate.
For each of the remaining candidates, the node calculates the midpoint between itself and the candidate.
If new peer list does not contain any nodes closer to the midpoint than the candidate, the candidate is added to the new peer list.
Otherwise, the candidate is set aside.



\section{UrDHT}
\label{sec:urdht}
	
	
	UrDHT is sectioned off into 3 broad components: database, network, and logic.
	Database handles file storage and network dictates the protocol for how nodes communicate.
	These components deal with the lower level mechanics of how files are stored on the network and how bits are transmitted through the network.
	Network Rest
	The specifics are outside the scope of the paper, but can be found on the UrDHT Project \cite{urdht}.
	
	The Logic component is what dictates the behavior of the DHT and the construction of the overlay network.
	It is composed of two parts: the DHT protocol and the space math.
	
	The DHT protocol is the canonical operations that a DHT performs, while the space math is what effectively distinguishes one DHT from another.
	The \texttt{space math} package in UrDHT is what needs to be changes to create a new type of DHT
	We discuss each in further detail below.
	
	
	\subsection{The DHT Protocol }
	%TODO in case of conflict with reality, move components from one section to another
	The DHT protocol is the shared functionality between every single DHT.
	It consists of the node's information, the short peer list to define the overlay, the long peers that make efficient routing possible, and a bunch of other stuff.
	
	Networking
	
	Maintenense is gossip
	\subsection{The Space Math}
	The space math consists of the functions which define the DHTs topology.
	
	The distance and midpoints functions are defined and discussed in detail in Section \ref{sec:hyper}	
	
	
	Space math just needs a Voronoi tessilation/ wahtever creator
	We provide DGVH for this, which works in every case we've tried.
	If you use DGVH, here's what needs to be changed.
	
	\subsubsection*{Put and Poll}
	The functions of \texttt{store} and \texttt{get} can be further abstracted otu to \texttt{put} and \texttt{poll}
	
	
	This does X


\section{Implementing other DHTs}
\label{sec:implement}
	\subsection{Implementing Chord and Ring-Based Topology}
	
	Ring topologies are fairly straightforward since they act as are one dimensional Voronoi Tesselations, splitting up what is effectively a modular number line among multiple nodes.
	
	
	\subsection{Implementing Kademlia and Other Tree Based Topologies}
	Trees are easy to embed in a hyperbolic space.
	
	The largest complication in implementing UrKademlia is defining the exclusive or, or XOR, metric which is used for distance.
	This metric, while non-euclidean, is perfectly acceptable for calculating distance in Kademlia \cite{kademlia}
	However, XOR does not have an intuitive midpoint we could use for DGVH.
	
	We found that
	
	\subsection{ZHT}
	ZHT \cite{li2013zht} leads to an extremely trivial implementation in UrDHT.
	ZHT is effectively Clique
	
	There is couple ways to solve this.
	
	\subsection{DHTs in a Hyperbolic Topology}
	
	\label{sec:hyper}
	

	
	\subsection{Okay, this is interesting, but why bother?}
	Because we it was difficult
	
	Because it shows that UrDHT and DGVH both work in arbitrary geometries.
	For example, handling geographic coordinates. 
	
	
	\subsection{Wait, Nodes can move in DHTs??}
	Yes, they can.  
	There's no rule against it. 
	In fact, it helps.
