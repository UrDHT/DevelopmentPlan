# Reading list.


These papers are excellent resources to get started on learning about distributed hash tables and P2P networks in general.
If you are completely new to the subject, I suggest starting with the very first paper listed.
Although a bit dated, it does provide a good deal of history along with the technical data.

# Specific DHTs
In our highly biased opinion Chord and Kademlia are the most important DHT papers.

##Security
Completely decentralized systems don't have a centralized location or node to attack; it's part of the definition.
DHT security focuses on preventing an adversary wresting control of the network.
The most prominent tool the adversary has is the *Sybil attack*, in which the attacker presents himself as multiple ``legitimate'' enities.  

Informally, the attacker pretends to be multiple individual nodes.
DHTs treat each individual node as equal members, so with enough identities, the attacker will intercept the majority of network traffic.
From there, the adversary can eavesdrop on most of the messages, or skip the eaves and move straight on to the dropping.
