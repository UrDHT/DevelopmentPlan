# DHT Logic Module

This module is the most complex and is close to being a god object for the project.
Most refinement and modifications required for re-purposing will happen here.

The DHT Logic exposes:

- seek(id) -> return a good forward peer for an id
- getPeers() -> return my current list of 1 hop peers
- getNotified(origin) -> notify me that origin exists
- DoIOwn(id) -> returns True iff I think I am responsible for an address.

The DHT Logic Depends On:

- Network Component: Allows communication with other nodes
	- Seek(remote,id) 
	- GetPeers(remote)
	- Notify(remote,origin)


DHT logic can be internally separated into two parts:
	- Reactive Logic:
		- dealing with queries
		- Has a dedicated worker, processes requests as fast as possible
	- Periodic Logic:
		- deals with maintenance
		- essentially an infinite loop with sleeps.

# TODO:
	- Decide on a good method for dealing with bad peers!!!!!

## Reactive Logic:
 Dealing with a reactive query should work as follows:
 ```
 	get read lock on peerinfo
 	copy needed peerinfo into local memory
 	release read lock on peerinfo
 	do required computation generally just a "findmax"
 	return value
```

## Periodic Logic:
```
	do while running:
		get read lock on peerinfo
		make local copy
		release read lock on peerinfo
		notify all peers
		sleep for a bit
		get read lock on new_canidates
		make a local copy
		release read lock on new_canidates
		new_peerlist = pick_new_peerlist(peerinfo_copy + new_canidates_copy)
		get write lock on peerinfo
		write new_peerlist over peerinfo
		release write lock on peerinfo
		sleep for a bit

```
